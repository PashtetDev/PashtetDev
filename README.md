## 💻 Programming

I really want to grow into a Senior tomato Unity developer and help my colleagues solve cool and difficult tasks!

I am currently continuing to learn and improve in C# and Unity. I am also studying design using computer technology at university

You can learn more about my experience in my [**CV**](https://myresume.ru/resume/A3tTk416ACQ/).


## 🕹️ Game designer

I have been studying game design since the summer of 2023. I understand prototyping game mechanics, artificial intelligence of enemies, boss battles and combat systems using C# respectively.

Now I'm opening a student gamedev club so that anyone can get acquainted with such a cool kind of art


## :space_invader: Game jams enthusiast
